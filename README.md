No. This is a third-party companion app built specifically for Termux users, but it integrates cleanly and safely with Termux APIs and permissions.

No.
Root is optional:

No — it enhances it.

❓ Is this safe to use?

Yes.

No ads

No tracking

No analytics

No internet access required

Absolutely.
It’s ideal for:

Script packs

Installers

Automation tools

Payload folders

Shops distributing Termux-based utilities

❓ Will this be on Google Play?

The GitHub release is always the most powerful version.
